# Engineering College Website

## Project Overview

This is a static multi-page brochure website for Engineering College, built with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, and vanilla JavaScript. It includes 6 pages: Home, About, Admissions, Student Life, Contact, and Registration.

Page Map:

- Home: Hero with CTA
- About: Intro and programs with cards, FAQ accordion
- Admissions: Process steps and fees table
- Student Life: Grid of campus snapshots
- Contact: Info and basic form
- Registration: Advanced form for prospects

## Features Implemented

- Responsive design (mobile-first, no horizontal scroll)
- Fixed top navigation with collapse on mobile
- Semantic HTML, alt text, labels, keyboard accessibility, color contrast
- Registration form: Validation (inline errors), password match, required fields, success state
- Contact form: Basic validation, anti-spam (simple math), success/failure messages
- Extra JS: FAQ accordion (toggle), Tooltips on program cards
- Consistent branding: Blue primary color, Roboto font, optimized placeholders for images

## Known Limitations

- Forms simulate submission (no server-side processing)
- No real images; uses placeholders (optimize real ones with tools like TinyPNG)
- Tested on common browsers; edge cases may vary
